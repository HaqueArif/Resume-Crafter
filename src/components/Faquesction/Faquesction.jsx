              Unless the job application specifically requests you not to send a
              cover letter, it’s good practice to send one. When written
              correctly, a good cover letter can be a strong companion to your
              resume, and be a critical factor in getting you a job interview.
              The best cover letters give you the chance to introduce yourself
              and your skills, explain why you’re a good fit for the job
              opportunity, and provide more depth and context on your
              achievements.
